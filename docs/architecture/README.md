# rLLM Architecture Documentation

This directory contains detailed architectural documentation for the rLLM framework.

## Documents

### [Quick Reference: Token ID Flow](quick_reference.md) ⚡

One-page quick reference showing how token IDs flow from vLLM to training. Perfect for a quick overview.

### [Token ID Capture Flow](token_id_capture_flow.md) 📖

Comprehensive technical documentation explaining how rLLM captures token IDs directly from vLLM inference servers and uses them for training without any retokenization. This ensures 100% fidelity between inference and training tokens.

**Key Topics**:
- vLLM instrumentation mechanism for token ID capture
- Trace storage protocol and data structures
- Training pipeline integration (VERL and Tinker)
- Configuration and verification
- Benefits and implementation notes

**Read this if you want to understand**:
- How token IDs flow from vLLM to training
- Why rLLM doesn't retokenize text
- How to enable and verify token ID capture
- Integration points in the training pipeline
